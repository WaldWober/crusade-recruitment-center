        <h2 class="centertxt child">Hi there, youngins!</h2>
            
        <p class="importantcenter"> Interested in fighting for your beliefs, but are barely old enough to make yourself toast? Do you live in intense poverty and squalor? Do your parents argue a lot and you feel like its your fault?</p>
            <p class="centertxt child"> If so, then come with us on a magical journey of learning and possible death and enslavement!

        <h2 class="child">Meet your new best friend!</h2>
            
            <img src="img/peteytheplaguedoctor.jpg" align="left" width="300" height="675"><p class ="big plague">Howdy do, urchins! It's me, Petey the Plague Doctor! I'm here to make sure you practice proper health and safety during holy wars. If one of your friends gets hurt or sick, be sure to take the following steps:</p>
            
            <ol class="plague">
                <li class="plague"> Don't look at them directly! One of the most common means of infection is through the eyeball. 
                    If you need to glance at your friend to see if they're still alive, be sure to use a looking glass.</li>
                <li class="plague"> Use leeches! Another common cause of illness is evil juice in the blood. Leeches love the taste of it, and will suck it right out of the bloodstream. </li>
                <li class="plague"> Pray! God protects the innocent, so many diseases can be attributed to a person's sins. Pray as hard as you can, lest you too become a victim of divine punishment. </li>
                <li class="plague"> Ostracize them! Let's be honest, by the time they start showing symptoms, it's already too late for them. Stop giving them rations and don't allow them to sleep with the group.
                    Remember, the loss of loved ones is part of the experience! </li>
            </ol>
